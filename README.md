# shell_imitation

My school project from Operatig System Course where we need to create a limited shell. The shell has the following commands:
1. listdir | Print out the contents of the directory.
2. mycomputername | Print the given name of the used device.
3. whatsmyip | Print out the current ip address
4. printfile <filename> | Print out the contents of the file line by line. Press enter to progress.
5. printfile <filename> > <newFileName> | Copy the contents of the <filename> to <newFileName>.
6. dididothat | Search up a command-line in a history composed of the last 15 commands.
dididothat -allhistory | Print out the last 15 commands in a chronological order. 
7. hellotext | Open the default GUI text editor of the system(Gedit in Ubuntu's case)
8. exit | Exit the shell
